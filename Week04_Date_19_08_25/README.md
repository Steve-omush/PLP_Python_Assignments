---

## 🚀 Features

- 📂 Read any text file
- ✨ Convert content to uppercase
- 💾 Save modified content to a new file
- 🛡️ Built-in error handling
- 🐍 Written in clean, readable Python

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The script asks for a filename to read
2. It reads the file content (if it exists)
3. Transforms the content to UPPERCASE
4. Saves the modified content to a new file with "modified_" prefix
5. Handles errors gracefully with helpful messages

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- A text file to process

### Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Enter the name of the file you want to process
3. Find your UPPERCASE version in the new file (prefixed with "modified_")

## 💡 Example

**Input file (test.txt):**
